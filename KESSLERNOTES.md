Using kessler in our modeling
- Spatial density can be used as we comply with kinetic gas theory
- We use probability of satellites location instead of predicted location
- flux = spatial density x velocity
- Number of collisions = flux x area x time
- Assuming idealized kepler orbits
    - anyway we could use ML to simulate slight deviations in order to get a more cohesive modeling???
    - Could factor in the left out assumptions of atmospheric drag, non-spherical gravity, and gravity of sun and moon
- Our probability function changes with time
    - slower the velocity more time in area, higher probability of getting hit
    - Time spent argument
- Function with latitude
  - Dont spend the same time at all altitudes
  - Spend more time near turning altitudes
  - Linger near max incline
  - Rush through equatorial orbits
  - Lambda is latitude analog
  - No preferred longitude
- Satellite cloud 
  - denser where satellites slow up around turning altitudes
- We get 3 seperate PDF's that match kesslers equations
- Collision Density model
- Velocity components
  - Component along track
  - North south velocity
  - Collision probability relates to relative velocity
  - Damage severity main issue
