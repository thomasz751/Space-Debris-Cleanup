Data on Debris
- 10 cm sized debris can destroy satellites
- 86 to 106 million costs per year
- Debris makes up 5-10% of budget of satellites
- Debris collision can make more debris
- Growing issue as more orbital structures are launched
- Fleet of launch also expensive
- We must reduce launch costs 
- Must be a properly sized satellite
- Small but powerful
- 85% of debris is in LEO
- around 34000 pieces larger than 10 cm (satellite destroying)
- Around 900000 between 1cm and 10cm (dangerous)
- 128 million between 1mm and 1cm
- Around 27000 pieces of space junk


First we have to come up with ideas for the satellite

- A few schools of thought
- Foam/Sticky Clean Up
  - Large phalanges that can catch certain wastes and is more resilient
  - More plastic type wastes, maybe metals
  - Smaller debris
  - Can also cause more space taken up in orbit that could hurt our mission of cleaning up orbital paths
- Net Clean Up
  - Larger waste
  - Shoots net or uses net to catch larger rocks or metal pieces
  - More impactful debris, more expensive less cleanup
  - Cleaning up debris that could potentially destroy satellites
- Redirection / Deorbiting
  - Removing things from orbit
  - Strategically redirecting things into oceans with orbital calculations
  - Crazy math but would be cheap
  - Lowest cost as no need for capture and breakdown or single use
  - Smaller debris can burn up, up to size of basketball apparently but certain materials might crash down
