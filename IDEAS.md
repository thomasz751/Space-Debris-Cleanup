Swarm Drones with mothership base
- launch mothership that acts as homebase
- each drone or whatever small hunter takes a specified piece of debris out of orbit
- could de orbit in some way
- maybe take small stuff into atmosphere and they both burn up
- maybe de orbit to the moon?????
- could you strike debris into the moon to get rid of it
- drones could even be resupplied 

Net Deploy
- Deploy net with winch and crank type system
- Capture debris then bring it out of orbit or into ship
- Easy capture
- Scalable to catch different size debris
- Best for pieces of metal debris/ satellite debris

Deflection System
- Somehow change orbit by deflecting debris either towards atmosphere or out of orbit
- Calculations to hit the ocean
- Needs some sort of force
- Very hard but cheapest solution

Electrodynamic Tether
- Uses magnetic field to slow down and cause orbital decay to debris
- Momentum Exchange

Beam/Laser Deflection
- Uses beam or laser to push debris out of the way
- Probably not enough

Drag Sail
- Attach cheaper tag sails that can cause orbital decay and deorbiting
- Carry many in a satellite

Foam/Sticky Solution
- A type of like web that can catch smaller debris
- Can catch lots of smaller debris however cant do much against larger
- 

We must pick a class of debris
- Most powerful would probably be a cheap way to grab big debris
- Could do a way to catch lots of debris as well
- Most likely needs to be debris that is harmful sized
